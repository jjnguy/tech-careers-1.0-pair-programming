# Tech Careers 1.0 Pair Programming Exercises

Problems picked from here - https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html

## Beginner

> Write a program that asks the user for a number `n` and prints the sum of the numbers `1` to `n`.

Example: User provides `6`. The program would calculate the sum - `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`

Thoughts: Start with a hard-coded number and get the addition working. From there move to getting user input.

## Intermediate

> Write a function that takes a list of strings and prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. 

Example: The list `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` gets printed as:

```
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
```

Thoughts: Input could either be hard-coded, or user supplied via a file of command line, etc. To add difficulty to the problem, you could ask the user if they'd like their words let aligned or right aligned. (Center aligned for even more difficulty.)

## Hard

> Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!

Example: The word `racecar` is a palindrome - so the longest palindromatic substring would be `racecar`. The word `careers` has `reer` in it as its longest palindromatic substring.

Thoughts: This might be a fun algorithm to use recursion to solve.

# Notes

It might be good to start with an easier problem that you have the best chance of completing. From there you can either iterate on your solution or move on to a harder problem.

Feel free to be creative with the problems. They are meant to be a starting point for the exercise. Adjust the criteria as you see fit. Add requirements, remove some. Change them. It's up to you.
