# Tech Careers 1.0 Pair Programming Exercises

Problems picked from here - https://adriann.github.io/programming_problems.html


## Beginner

> Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n.

Example: User provides 6. The program would calculate the sum - `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`

## Intermediate

> Write a function that takes a list of strings an prints them, one per line, in a rectangular frame. 

Example: The list `["Hello", "World", "in", "a", "frame"]` gets printed as:

```
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
```

Thoughts: Input could either be hard-coded, or user supplied via a file of command line, etc. To add difficulty to the problem, you could ask the user if they'd like their words let aligned or right aligned. (Center aligned for even more difficulty.)

## Hard

> Write a program that finds the longest palindromic substring of a given string. Try to be as efficient as possible!

Example: The word `racecar` is a palindrome - so the longest palindromatic substring would be `racecar`. The word `careers` has `reer` in it as its longest palindromatic substring.

Thoughts: This might be a fun algorithm to use recursion to solve.
